# Carrier RIF

## Overview

The Carrier file (also known as the Physician/Supplier Part B claims file) contains final action fee-for-service claims submitted on a CMS-1500 claim form. Most of the claims are from non-institutional providers, such as physicians, physician assistants, clinical social workers, nurse practitioners. Claims for other providers, such as free-standing facilities are also found in the Carrier file.  Examples include independent clinical laboratories, ambulance providers, and free-standing ambulatory surgical centers. This file includes:

- diagnosis and procedure (ICD-9 diagnosis, CMS Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes),
- dates of service,
- reimbursement amounts,
- provider numbers (e.g., UPIN, PIN, NPI), and
- beneficiary demographic information

Availability: CY 1999 - 2015

The 12-month run-off final action claims for 2016 will be available in the beginning of 2018.
