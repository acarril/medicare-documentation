# Hospice RIF

## Overview

The Hospice file contains final action claims submitted by Hospice providers. Once a beneficiary elects Hospice, all Hospice related claims will be found in this file, regardless if the beneficiary is in Medicare fee-for-service or in a Medicare managed care plan. This file includes:

- the level of hospice care received (e.g., routine home care, inpatient respite care),
- terminal diagnosis (ICD-9 diagnosis),
- the dates of service,
- reimbursement amounts,
- Hospice provider number, and
- beneficiary demographic information.

Availability: CY 1999 - 2015

The 12-month run-off final action claims for 2016 will be available in the beginning of 2018.
